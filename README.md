# Overview

> Disclaimer: This is an independent personal project. I do not own the rights to monopoly and am not affiliated with Hasbro.

This project will include a playable monopoly game using the MVC design paradigm, a trading system for transactions between players, CLI for user input, and an AI system to optimize decision making. There will also be a module for game theory, statistics, and heuristics for different economic factors in the game. The ruleset is based off of the [Monopoly Wiki](https://monopoly.fandom.com/wiki/House_Rules), personal interpretation, as well as popular consensus on how to game is usually played. This project also contains extensive unit testing and will likely be subject to improvement in the near future.
